# Sarajevo-Sonic-Studio
Sarajevo Sonic Studio initiative is actually political in nature: It occurs at the time when political elites in Bosnia and Herzegovina decided that culture, and art at its most subtle form, will not be a priority for the development of the nation. Now, when their policies have caused uncontrolled impoverishing of the social Body, it seems that, almost in organized way, they are working on depleting the Spirit. That is not a coincidence: they feel that art, the real, thinking, searching, provoking, immortal art, is their most dangerous enemy - art requests the spirit to be awake and resist, it requires awareness and consciousness.
